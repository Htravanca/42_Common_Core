your code is well-structured, but I see a few potential issues that could cause problems. Here are my observations:
Possible Issues and Fixes
1. Philosopher with id % 2 == 0 sleeping for only usleep(5);

    Issue: The usleep(5); in ft_table() is way too short to have any meaningful effect (5 microseconds is almost negligible).
    Fix: If you intended to stagger philosopher start times, use a larger value, like usleep(1000); (1ms) or ft_precise_sleep(500, philo);.

2. Deadlock Risk in eat() Function

    Issue: The eating function locks r_fork first and then l_fork. If all philosophers try to lock their right fork simultaneously, it can lead to deadlock.
    Fix: A common solution is to ensure one philosopher locks l_fork first instead of r_fork, like:

    if (philo->id % 2 == 0)
    {
        pthread_mutex_lock(philo->l_fork);
        pthread_mutex_lock(philo->r_fork);
    }
    else
    {
        pthread_mutex_lock(philo->r_fork);
        pthread_mutex_lock(philo->l_fork);
    }

3. Single Philosopher Can't Eat

    Issue: If there's only one philosopher (num_philos == 1), the program will lock the right fork and then get stuck waiting for the left fork forever.
    Fix: Add a check for num_philos == 1, make the philosopher pick up the fork, wait time_to_die, print a message, then exit.

4. Missing Synchronization for someone_died Flag

    Issue: someone_died is checked in ft_dead_loop() but modified elsewhere. Multiple threads accessing it without pthread_mutex_lock() could cause undefined behavior.
    Fix: Always protect reads/writes to someone_died with pthread_mutex_lock(philo->dead_lock);.

5. Monitor Thread is Commented Out

    Issue: The monitor thread (ft_initmonitorthread() and ft_joinmonitorthread()) is commented out, meaning there's no proper mechanism to detect when a philosopher dies.
    Fix: Uncomment the monitor thread functions and implement ft_monitor_routine().

6. Potential Race Condition in ft_print_msg()

    Issue: The function checks ft_dead_loop(philo) after locking write_lock, but if a philosopher dies right after the check, it may still print a message.
    Fix: Instead of:

    if (!ft_dead_loop(philo))

    You should check before locking or handle it inside the lock.

7. Unnecessary Sleep After Unlocking Forks

    Issue: ft_precise_sleep(3, philo); is called after unlocking the forks.
    Fix: This is unnecessary; just remove it.

Suggestions

    Ensure the Monitor Thread Works
        It should continuously check whether a philosopher has exceeded time_to_die since their last meal and set someone_died = true.

    Improve ft_precise_sleep() Efficiency
        usleep(200); is relatively inefficient. Instead, check time every 50us or 100us.

    Use printf() in a Safer Way
        Printing inside threads can be a performance bottleneck. Consider buffering output to print fewer times.

Final Thoughts

Your implementation is close to working, but it needs better synchronization, a working monitor, and some safety measures to avoid deadlocks and starvation.

Would you like me to help you implement the missing monitor thread? ðŸš€
